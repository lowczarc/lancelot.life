        <p>A collection of small articles, mostly me rambling about random subjects.<br/>Some of them are generated with an LLM with a recording of my voice using <a href="https://github.com/lowczarc/voice2article/">voice2article</a>, some of them are written by myself. I don't mark them but you'll probably be able to tell anyway which is voice2article and which one is me.</p>
        <p>Theses are very low efforts and are just here to get my thoughts out, they might not be very interesting, if you want to read something with a bit more thoughts put into it, you can visit my <a href="https://blog.lancelot.life">Blog</a></p>
