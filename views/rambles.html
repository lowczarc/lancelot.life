        <p>A collection of things I want to share.<br/>Some of them are articles generated with an LLM using with a recording of my voice with <a href="https://github.com/lowczarc/voice2article/">voice2article</a>, some of them are written by myself. Some are just files I wanted to share (in this case the title has an extension). I don't mark the LLM ones but I have faith in the face that you'll probably be able to tell which are voice2article and which are me.</p>
        <p>Theses are very low efforts and are just here to get my thoughts out, they might not be very interesting, if you want to read something with a bit more thoughts put into it, you can visit my <a href="https://blog.lancelot.life">Blog</a></p>
