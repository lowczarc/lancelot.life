		<p>Have you ever felt like you have two conflicting sides within you? A
		part of you that takes action and another part that observes and judges?
		In this article, we explore the concept of the “actor” and the
		“observer” that reside within our minds and the dynamic between
		them.</p>
		<h2 id="the-actor-vs.-the-observer">The Actor vs. The Observer</h2>
		<p>At some point in our lives, we may have pondered about the duality of
		our existence. We can perceive ourselves as being divided into two
		distinct roles: the actor and the observer. However, the assigned labels
		can be misleading. The actor, despite its name, is not just someone who
		performs actions. Likewise, the observer is not merely a spectator.
		Let’s dive deeper into their roles.</p>
		<h3 id="the-actor-making-decisions-and-taking-action">The Actor: Making
		Decisions and Taking Action</h3>
		<p>The actor is the driving force behind our actions. It has the final
		say in the decisions we make and the behaviors we exhibit. This part of
		us seeks simple pleasures, like enjoying a cup of tea, indulging in
		delicious food, or being in good physical shape. Its desires are rooted
		in immediate gratification and the pursuit of personal enjoyment.</p>
		<h3 id="the-observer-reasoning-and-judging">The Observer: Reasoning and
		Judging</h3>
		<p>On the other hand, the observer is the voice inside our heads. It
		reflects upon our actions, judges our choices, and serves as our
		critical thinker. While the observer is the one speaking right now, it
		fuels a constant desire for ideals. Although the exact ideal may not
		always be clear, the observer longs for something greater, something
		beyond the simple pleasures pursued by the actor.</p>
		<h2 id="the-conflict-within">The Conflict Within</h2>
		<p>Naturally, these two characters within us often find themselves at
		odds with one another. For example, a person who is inherently lazy but
		yearns to accomplish great things may experience this conflict
		intensely. The observer may nag and complain about the actions (or lack
		thereof) taken by the actor. So, how can we address this inner
		conflict?</p>
		<p>For a long time, I believed that the solution was for the observer to
		take control. I thought that if the observer were to realize its own
		ability to act, it could then guide the actor towards achieving grand
		aspirations. However, I now realize that this approach overly
		prioritizes rationality.</p>
		<h2 id="embracing-the-roles">Embracing the Roles</h2>
		<p>The observer, known for its rationality, can also lean towards
		nihilism. Nihilism suggests that there is no inherent meaning to life,
		no foundation for our moral reasoning or beliefs. The actor, however,
		cares little about nihilism. It engages in simple reasoning like, “I
		enjoy tea,” or “I love chocolate,” or even “I feel great when I
		exercise.” The actor does not question the why or how behind its
		preferences.</p>
		<p>In fact, I now recognize that it is the observer who must acknowledge
		its purpose: to serve the actor. Rather than trying to gain control over
		the actor, the observer’s true role is to care for this inner child. The
		actor represents that childlike innocence within us, and the observer’s
		purpose is to nurture and attend to its needs.</p>
		<h2 id="finding-meaning-in-service">Finding Meaning in Service</h2>
		<p>By understanding that the observer’s purpose is to serve the actor,
		nihilism loses its relevance. The observer’s reason for existence
		becomes clear: to take care of the actor and ensure its well-being.
		Instead of seeking grand ideals or grappling with the lack of meaning,
		the observer’s meaning lies in tending to the actor’s desires and
		pursuing the simple pleasures that bring joy and contentment.</p>
		<p>In conclusion, acknowledging the duality of the actor and the
		observer within ourselves allows us to better understand the conflicts
		we face. By embracing their roles and recognizing the purpose of each,
		we can create a harmonious balance within ourselves. So, let us strive
		to nurture our inner child, the actor, while the observer guides and
		ensures its well-being.</p>
